    <br/>The goal of this website is to draw customers in and get them excited about<br/>
    the products as well as the designs and lifestyles that it advocates. The site <br/>
    accentuates a minimalist, modern, and bright design with many links to get <br/>
    people's attention.

    <p>
      The website now has a more concise structure that doesn't feature as much scrolling.<br/>
      My redesign also includes more links to things across the site, which may draw reader <br/>
      attention further should they decide to stay on the page statically and not scroll down <br/>
      like the page currently has the reader/user do.
